Below is a comprehensive roadmap for the **Tennis Error Tracker** web application project. This roadmap outlines the key phases, tasks, and estimated timelines to guide the development process from initial setup to a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The project will be developed locally using **Go** for the backend, **PostgreSQL** for the database, and **ReactJS** for the frontend, with future plans for hosting on Google Cloud. The app will support multiple users, allowing them to log unforced errors during tennis matches and view summaries of their errors per session.

### Project Roadmap: Tennis Error Tracker

#### **Overview**
The Tennis Error Tracker is a web app designed to help tennis players track unforced errors (e.g., Forehand, Backhand, Serve, Volley) during matches and analyze their performance through session summaries. The total estimated time to build the MVP is **4-6 weeks**, assuming part-time development (e.g., 10-15 hours per week). Adjust the timeline based on your availability and experience.

This roadmap is divided into six phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables to ensure a systematic approach to development.

---

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning**
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

**Tasks**:
- [x] Set up version control using Git (e.g., create a repository on GitHub).
- [x] Create the project folder structure:
  - `/backend` for Go code.
  - `/frontend` for ReactJS code.
  - `/db` for database scripts.
- [x] Install necessary tools and dependencies:
  - Go (version 1.16+).
  - PostgreSQL (version 12+).
  - Node.js (version 14+) and npm (version 6+).
- [x] Define API contracts (endpoints and data formats) to align backend and frontend development.

**Deliverables**:
- Initialized Git repository.
- Organized project structure.
- Development environment fully set up.

---

#### **Phase 2: Database Design and Setup**
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

**Tasks**:
- [x] Design the database schema:
    - `Users` table: `user_id` (PK), `username`, `password_hash`.
    - `Match_Sessions` table: `session_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK), `start_time`, `end_time`.
    - `Error_Types` table: `error_type_id` (PK), `name` (e.g., "Forehand", "Backhand").
    - `Error_Logs` table: `error_id` (PK), `session_id` (FK), `error_type_id` (FK), `timestamp`.
- [x] Write SQL scripts or use an ORM (e.g., GORM) to create the tables.
- Seed the `Error_Types` table with predefined error types: "Forehand", "Backhand", "Serve", "Volley".

**Deliverables**:
- Fully implemented database schema in PostgreSQL.
- Predefined error types populated in the database.

---

#### **Phase 3: Backend Development**
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks

**Tasks**:
- Set up a Go backend framework (e.g., Gin or Echo).
- Implement authentication:
  - `POST /register`: Register a new user with username and password.
  - `POST /login`: Authenticate user and return a JWT token.
  - Middleware to protect endpoints with JWT validation.
- Create API endpoints:
  - `POST /sessions`: Start a new match session.
  - `PUT /sessions/{session_id}`: End an active session.
  - `GET /sessions`: Retrieve a list of the userâ€™s past sessions.
  - `POST /errors`: Log an error for the current session.
  - `DELETE /errors/last`: Undo the last error in the current session.
  - `GET /sessions/{session_id}/summary`: Get an error summary for a session.
  - `GET /error-types`: Retrieve the list of error types.
- Implement database interactions for each endpoint using GORM or raw SQL.
- Add input validation and error handling (e.g., invalid session IDs, unauthorized access).

**Deliverables**:
- A fully functional backend with secure authentication and API endpoints.
- Backend connected to the PostgreSQL database.

---

#### **Phase 4: Frontend Development**
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks

**Tasks**:
- Set up the ReactJS project using `create-react-app` or a similar tool.
- Create key components:
  - `Login.js`: Form for user login.
  - `Register.js`: Form for user registration.
  - `SessionStart.js`: Button to start a new session.
  - `ErrorLogging.js`: Interface with buttons for each error type and an undo option.
  - `SessionList.js`: Display a list of past sessions.
  - `SummaryView.js`: Show a summary of errors for a selected session.
- Implement routing between pages (e.g., using React Router).
- Use Axios or Fetch to connect to backend API endpoints.
- Manage state (e.g., with React Context or Redux) for user sessions and error data.
- Style the app for mobile-friendliness using CSS frameworks (e.g., Material-UI) or custom CSS.

**Deliverables**:
- A responsive ReactJS frontend with all core features.
- Functional API integration for user interactions.

---

#### **Phase 5: Integration and Testing**
**Estimated Time**: 1 week

**Tasks**:
- Connect the frontend to the backend APIs.
- Test key functionalities:
  - Authentication (register, login, logout).
  - Session management (start, end, list).
  - Error logging and undo actions.
  - Summary generation and display.
- Perform end-to-end testing to ensure seamless operation.
- Debug and resolve any issues (e.g., API errors, UI glitches).

**Deliverables**:
- A fully integrated and tested web application.
- Bug-free functionality across all features.

---

#### **Phase 6: Documentation and Refinement**
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

**Tasks**:
- Write or update `README.md` with:
  - Project overview.
  - Setup instructions.
  - Usage guide.
- Refine the UI/UX based on testing feedback (e.g., adjust button sizes, add loading states).
- Optimize performance if needed (e.g., minimize API calls, improve load times).
- Document steps for future Google Cloud deployment.

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive project documentation.
- A polished, user-friendly application ready for use.

---

#### **Future Phase: Deployment to Google Cloud**
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks (post-MVP)

**Tasks**:
- Set up Google Cloud services:
  - Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL hosting.
  - Cloud Run for the Go backend.
  - Cloud Storage for the React frontend (static site).
- Configure environment variables and secrets management.
- Implement CI/CD with Cloud Build for automated deployments.
- Test the deployed app in the cloud environment.

**Deliverables**:
- A live, hosted version of the Tennis Error Tracker accessible online.

---

### **Key Considerations**
- **Security**: Use hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt) and secure JWT handling.
- **Performance**: Ensure the error logging interface is fast and responsive for real-time use during matches.
- **Scalability**: Design the database and backend to support multiple users efficiently.
- **Time Zones**: Store timestamps in UTC and handle conversions on the frontend.

### **Tracking Progress**
Use a tool like Trello, GitHub Projects, or a simple checklist to break down tasks, prioritize them, and track completion. This will keep the project organized and on schedule.

To determine the requirements for your tennis error tracking web app project, I’ll provide a user story that captures the core functionality you might need, based on the idea of a tennis player wanting to improve their game by tracking unforced errors. If I need any clarification, I’ll ask you questions along the way. Here’s the user story:

### User Story
**As a tennis player, I want to log my unforced errors by type during a match using a mobile-friendly web app and view summaries of these errors per match session, so that I can analyze my performance and improve my game.**

This user story reflects a tennis player’s desire to track errors in real-time during matches and review them later to identify weaknesses. It’s broad enough to define the project’s purpose but specific enough to derive meaningful requirements. Below, I’ll break it down into detailed requirements for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). If you have specific preferences (e.g., additional features, target audience, or technical constraints), please let me know!

---

### Derived Requirements for the MVP

#### 1. User Authentication
- **Why**: To ensure the app is personal and secure, allowing each user to access their own data.
- **Requirements**:
  - Users can register with a username and password.
  - Users can log in to access their personal error tracking data.
  - Passwords are stored securely (e.g., hashed using a strong algorithm like bcrypt).
  - Session management uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access to protected features.


---

#### 2. Match Sessions
- **Why**: To organize errors by specific matches, making it easier to review performance contextually.
- **Requirements**:
  - Users can start a new match session, creating a record with a start time.
  - Users can end a match session, updating the record with an end time.
  - Users can view a list of past match sessions, ordered by date, to select and review.

---

#### 3. Error Logging
- **Why**: To allow quick and easy logging of unforced errors during a match without disrupting play.
- **Requirements**:
  - Users can log an unforced error by selecting a predefined error type (e.g., “Forehand”, “Backhand”, “Serve”, “Volley”) via a single tap.
  - Each error log includes:
    - The session ID it belongs to.
    - The error type ID.
    - A timestamp (stored in UTC, displayed in the user’s local time zone).
  - An “Undo” feature lets users delete the most recent error logged in the current session (e.g., in case of an accidental tap).
  - The interface is mobile-friendly, with large, tappable buttons for each error type.

---

#### 4. Error Summary
- **Why**: To provide insights into error frequency and types after a match, aiding performance analysis.
- **Requirements**:
  - Users can view a summary for a specific match session.
  - The summary shows:
    - A count of each error type (e.g., “Forehand: 5, Backhand: 3, Serve: 2”).
    - A total error count for the session.
  - The summary is accessible after ending a session or by selecting a past session from the list.

---

#### 5. Frontend Interface
- **Why**: To ensure usability, especially on mobile devices during matches.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on phones and tablets with a mobile-first approach.
  - **Screens**:
    - **Login/Register**: For user authentication.
    - **Session Start**: A button to begin a new match session.
    - **Error Logging**: Displays large buttons for each error type and an “Undo” button during an active session.
    - **Session List**: Shows past sessions with dates, clickable to view summaries.
    - **Summary View**: Displays the error breakdown for a selected session.
  - Error types are fetched dynamically from the backend to populate the logging buttons.

---

#### 6. Backend API
- **Why**: To handle data operations and serve the frontend efficiently.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Endpoints**:
    - `POST /register`: Create a new user.
    - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT.
    - `POST /sessions`: Start a new match session.
    - `PUT /sessions/{session_id}`: End a session.
    - `GET /sessions`: Retrieve the user’s list of past sessions.
    - `POST /errors`: Log a new error for the current session.
    - `DELETE /errors/last`: Undo the last error in the current session.
    - `GET /sessions/{session_id}/summary`: Get the error summary for a session.
    - `GET /error-types`: Retrieve the list of predefined error types.
  - All endpoints (except registration/login) are protected by JWT authentication.

---

#### 7. Database Schema
- **Why**: To store and organize user data, sessions, and errors.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Users**: 
    - `user_id` (primary key), `username`, `password_hash`.
  - **Match_Sessions**: 
    - `session_id` (primary key), `user_id` (foreign key), `start_time`, `end_time`.
  - **Error_Types**: 
    - `error_type_id` (primary key), `name` (e.g., “Forehand”).
    - Pre-seeded with a standard set of error types.
  - **Error_Logs**: 
    - `error_id` (primary key), `session_id` (foreign key), `error_type_id` (foreign key), `timestamp`.

---

#### 8. Security
- **Why**: To protect user data and ensure the app is reliable.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use HTTPS for all communications.
  - Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to restrict requests to the frontend domain.
  - Store sensitive data (e.g., passwords) securely.

---

#### 9. Deployment
- **Why**: To make the app accessible over the internet, even for personal use.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Backend**: Hosted on Google Cloud Run.
  - **Database**: Hosted on Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL).
  - **Frontend**: Hosted on Cloud Storage as a static site.
  - Use Cloud Build for continuous integration and deployment.
  - Local development can connect to Cloud SQL for testing.

---

#### 10. Additional Considerations
- **Time Zones**: Timestamps are stored in UTC and converted to the user’s local time zone in the frontend (detected by the browser).
- **Connectivity**: The app assumes internet access for real-time logging; offline support is not included in the MVP.
- **Monitoring**: Use Google Cloud’s Stackdriver for logging and monitoring once deployed.

---

### Tech Stack Suggestion
- **Backend**: Go (e.g., with Gin or Echo framework) for performance and simplicity.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data management.
- **Frontend**: ReactJS for a responsive, dynamic interface, with Axios for API calls and a UI library (e.g., Material-UI) for styling.
